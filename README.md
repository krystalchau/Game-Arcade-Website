## GAMES!
A website where you can play 3 different games.

### Sliding Puzzle
Made by Judith Nuno Garcia.

### Magic Bakery
Inspired by Cookie Clicker, click the cake to gain cake stock it, sell your cake to insatiable cake connoisseurs, and buy power ups with your earnings to increase your cake output.
Made by Krystal Chau.

There is no "win" to Magic Bakery. The goal is to click to ones content just as one plays Cookie Clicker. The more you play the easier it is to gain cake.

With more time I planned to make more power ups, add different varieties of cake that sells for higher costs, and helping hands that would collect cake while the user is idle.

### Dinosaur Run
Originally by [georgephillips](https://github.com/CloudCannon/Dinosaur-Chrome-Game).
The classic Dinosaur Chrome Game only with an internet connection!

### Website Overall Style
We wanted the website to look intentionally low effort as it gives an overall cuter theme with the drawn icons.

With more time we are planning to add fake handdrawn ads and easter eggs with animations.
